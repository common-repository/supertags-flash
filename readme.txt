== Installation ==

= Installation =
1. Make sure you're running WordPress version 2.3 or better. It won't work with older versions.

1. Activate the plugin through the 'plugins' page in WP.
1. See 'Options->SuperTags Flash' to adjust things like display size, etc...

= In order to actually display the tag cloud, you have three options. =
1. Create a page or post and type [supertags-flash] anywhere in the content. This 'tag' will be replaced by the flash movie when viewing the page. 
1. Add the following code anywhere in your theme to display the cloud. `<?php supertags_flash_insert(); ?>` This can be used to add WP Cumulus to your sidebar, although it may not actually be wide enough in many cases to keep the tags readable.
1. The plugin adds a widget, so you can place it on your sidebar through 'Appearance'->'Widgets'. Open the widget to access it's own set of settings (background color, size, etc).
